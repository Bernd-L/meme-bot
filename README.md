## Features

MemeBot enriches a guild with the following features:

- Memes
  - Indirect posting
  - With attribution or anonymous
- Anonymous confessions
  - Optional coloring based on roles
- Reaction-based voting
  - Remove memes with too many downvotes
  - Vote contradiction mitigation (can't upvote AND downvote)
- Multi-guild support
  - One instance of MemeBot may serve several guilds at once

## Getting started

Setup is quick and easy.

1. Get an instance of MemeBot and its invite link
2. Add MemeBot to the guild using said invite link
3. Create a dedicated bot-command channel
4. Type the `mb init` command and hit return in the bot-command channel
5. Create a meme channel and a confession channel (if they don't exist already; both are optional)
6. Optional (but recommended) configuration
   1. Enter `mb meme #meme-channel-name` to set the meme channel
   2. Enter `mb confession #confession-channel-name` to set the confession channel
7. You may enter the `mb downvote 10` command to set the downvote limit to `<=10`
8. Enter the `mb name mas` to set the guilds name to "mas" (see [configuration](##Configuration))

And you're all set.

## Configuration

MemeBot provides help to any command using the `mb -h` command.
Any other sub-command may also get `-h` appended to learn more about it.

Most commands and options have abbreviations. Check `mb -h` to see the all.
For example, `--disable` may be substituted by `-d`, and `cmd-channel` by `cmd`.

The following may be configured by an admin:

- Meme channel `mb meme -h`
  - Set to a channel `mb meme #meme-channel`
    - The old channel will not get modified
    - The new channel will become the chanel in which MemeBot posts new memes

## Users' manual

This section focuses on how a user (non-admin) may interact with MemeBot.

A user may only interact with MemeBot via a direct message (DM) to MemeBot.
For more details a user may always DM MemeBot with `mb -h`.
Furthermore, `-h` may be appended to any command to learn more about any command.

A user can:

- Select a server
  - This is required for MemeBot to know where to post
    - Neither memes nor confessions can be submitted without this
  - Enter `mb server serverName` where "serverName" is the name configured by the admins
  - The user can view the selected server using `mb server`
  - Deselecting a selected server is not supported (but changing it is)
- Submit memes
  - Post meme first (picture or video)
  - Then enter `mb meme` (add `-a` to stay anonymous)
- Submit confessions
  - Type `mb conf "My multi-word confession with \"escaped quotes\" and a closing quote"`
  - Confessions are always posted anonymously
  - Confessions must be enclosed with double quotes `"`
  - If a confession should contain quotes itself, they must be escaped `\"`
