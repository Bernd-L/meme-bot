The goad of the MemeBot is to organize a Discord servers meme channel into 9Gag-like areas.
This is accomplished by the owner creating two or three channels:

- Fresh
- Trending
- Hot

The trending area is optional (TODO).

When a submission reaches a certain number of upvotes (emoji-reactions, the up- and downvote emojis can be configured), it gets copied to the next area.

A user who doesn't want to get pinged that often may only subscribe to the Hot ara.

## Features

The MemeBot comes with many great features.
Here are a bunch of them:

- Copy memes form one area to the next
- Remove a copied meme from the old channel (optional)
- Allow/Prohibit anonymous posting
- Auto-remove disliked memes
- Alert an admin of repeated offenses

The admin can configure

- The number of upvotes required to get a post into the next area
- If downvoting should be allowed
- Which emoji gets treated as the upvote
- Which emoji gets treated as the downvote
- Whether or not the bot should take submissions via DM to submit anonymously

## Implementation

To improve your servers meme channel, tell your admin to execute the following easy steps:

1. Add the bot to the server
2. Create a dedicated bot-command channel
3. Write the `!MB init` command and hit return
4. Set up the channels that are going to be the areas for your memes (Fresh, Trending (optional), Hot)
5. Set up another set of area-channels to form another section (optional) (TODO)
6. Use `!MB section default area fresh #fresh` given `#fresh` is your channel name
7. Use `!MB section default area trending #trending` given `#trending` is your channel name (optional)
8. Use `!MB section default no area trending` to disable the trending area (optional)
9. Use `!MB section default area hot #hot` given `#hot` is your channel name

And you're all set.
